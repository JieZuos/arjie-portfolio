        "project_description": "The Event and Raffle System was designed and developed for Juan D. Nepomuceno (JDN) to streamline the management of events and allow users to actively participate. The system enables event organizers to create and manage events, while participants can register, view event details, and engage in raffles. This system simplifies the process for both organizers and participants, ensuring seamless event execution with an integrated raffle component for added excitement.",

        "image_count": 1,
        "problem": "Before the system was introduced, event organizers faced challenges in managing attendee participation and event logistics. Tracking participant registration, handling event updates, and organizing raffles for attendees were all done manually, which resulted in inefficiencies, delayed communication, and a disorganized event flow.",
        "solution": "The Event Raffle and Event System automated the entire process, providing a centralized platform where organizers could easily create events, manage registrations, and handle event-related tasks. Participants were able to register online, receive timely event updates, and automatically enroll in raffles. The systemâ€™s raffle feature ensured fairness and transparency in selecting winners, while simplifying participant management and event tracking for the organizers.",

        "problem": "The manual process for requesting rides for official business was labor-intensive, time-consuming, and susceptible to errors, lacking an efficient method for tracking vehicle availability.",
        "solution": "Implemented a web-based system that enables users to digitally submit ride requests, allowing supervisors to approve or decline them. The administrative department can then allocate available cars and drivers based on real-time data. The system also features automated notifications for upcoming rides and returns, facilitating streamlined tracking and management.",

It includes multiple input validations, customizable categories, and features for issuing, returning, preventive maintenance (with checks for maintenance periods), approval for disposal, and archiving of previous data. The system also allows for adding spare parts for each asset, generates reports of asset activity, creates QR codes for asset tags, and can scan device barcodes or QR codes for receiving assets for maintenance.",
